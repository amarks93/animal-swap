# Animal Swap

Simple React demo created for students.

npm install

npm run start:dev

## Branches
1. main - plain React (ps also doesn't have CSS so looks plain) 
2. redux-start - starting point for integrating redux
3. redux-solution - finished product
4. lunch-demo - similar to redux-solution, but incorporates buttons and has a few notes
